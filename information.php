        To get started on this challenge, you probably have everything you need
        already installed on your computer. All you need is a text editor and a
        web browser. Optionally, you can use an IDE if you wish.

        To create an HTML file: Use a text editor (such as NotePad), write your
        HTML code, and save the file as a ‘.html’ file type. You can open the
        file in your browser to see your webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a CSS file: Use a text editor (such as NotePad), write your
        CSS code, and save the file as a ‘.css’ file type. The CSS file should
        be kept in the same folder as the HTML file(s) it is for.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should create a folder for your website with all of the relevant
        files.
